# Web application hosting using AWS CDK and TypeScript

In this post, we explain how to define the infrastructure required to host a web application using CDK and TypeScript.

## Overview

What we want to achieve with this tutorial is to host and serve a HTML based web application. For that, we will need the following resources:

- An S3 bucket for file hosting
- A CloudFront distribution for CDN
- A Route 53 managed hosted zone for our custom domain
- An ACM managed SSL certificate to enable HTTPS with our custom domain

## Defining the stack

Let's start with defining the stack that all of our resources will reside:

```
import { Stack, StackProps } from 'aws-cdk-lib';
import { Construct } from 'constructs';

interface WebappStackProps extends StackProps {
  domain: string;
}

export class WebappStack extends Stack {

  constructor(scope: Construct, id: string, props: WebappStackProps) {
    super(scope, id, props);
  }
}

```

This will create an empty stack. Next, let's define the resources we need to host a web application.

The full project is available on GitHub.

## Bucket and origin access identity

The below code creates a bucket that will hold the HTML and asset files that make up the web application.

```
const bucket = new Bucket(this, 'WebappHostingBucket', {
  websiteIndexDocument: 'index.html',
  websiteErrorDocument: 'index.html',
  blockPublicAccess: new BlockPublicAccess({ restrictPublicBuckets: false }),
  removalPolicy: RemovalPolicy.DESTROY,
  autoDeleteObjects: true,
});
```

The below code creates an origin access identity (OAI) that allows the CloudFront CDN to access the S3 bucket and serve the files inside it.

```
const oai = new OriginAccessIdentity(this, 'WebappCloudFrontOriginAccessIdentity');
bucket.grantRead(oai.grantPrincipal);
```

## Hosted zone and certificate

The below code creates a hosted zone that holds the domain that we want to use for our web application

```
const hostedZone = new HostedZone(this, 'HostedZone', { zoneName: props.domain });
```

Let's add the Route 53 name servers for our domain as outputs to the stack. Once the stack is deployed, you need to point your domain to these name servers.

```
if (hostedZone.hostedZoneNameServers) {
  new CfnOutput(this, 'NameServers', { value: Fn.join(', ', hostedZone.hostedZoneNameServers) });
}
```

Next, let's create an ACM managed certificate that allows us to enable HTTPS for the web application

```
const certificate: DnsValidatedCertificate | null = new DnsValidatedCertificate(this, 'Certificate', {
  domainName: props.domain,
  subjectAlternativeNames: [props.domain, `www.${props.domain}`],
  validation: CertificateValidation.fromDns(hostedZone),
  region: 'us-east-1',
  hostedZone: hostedZone,
  cleanupRoute53Records: true,
});
```

## CloudFront distribution (CDN)

The below code creates a CloudFront distribution that acts as a CDN for our web application. The CloudFront distribution points to our S3 bucket as an origin and uses our ACM certificate.

```
  const distribution = new CloudFrontWebDistribution(this, 'WebappDistribution', {
    viewerCertificate: ViewerCertificate.fromAcmCertificate(certificate, {
      aliases: [props.domain, `www.${props.domain}`],
      securityPolicy: SecurityPolicyProtocol.TLS_V1_2_2021,
      sslMethod: SSLMethod.SNI,
    }),
    originConfigs: [
      {
        s3OriginSource: {
          s3BucketSource: bucket,
          originAccessIdentity: oai,
        },
        behaviors: [{ isDefaultBehavior: true }],
      },
    ],
    errorConfigurations: [
      {
        errorCode: 404,
        errorCachingMinTtl: 300,
        responseCode: 200,
        responsePagePath: '/index.html',
      },
    ],
  });

  bucket.grantRead(oai.grantPrincipal);
```

## A-record

Finally, an A-record is created in our hosted zone that points the domain to the CloudFront distribution that serves our web application

```
  new ARecord(this, 'WebappARecord', {
    target: RecordTarget.fromAlias(new CloudFrontTarget(distribution)),
    zone: hostedZone,
    recordName: `${props.domain}`,
  });
```
